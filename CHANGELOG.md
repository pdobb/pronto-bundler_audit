### 0.6.1 - 2021-04-08
- [#7](https://github.com/pdobb/pronto-bundler_audit/pull/10) Pronto 0.11.0 compatibility
  - Fix Pronto -> GitHub call :publish_pull_request_comments instead of :create_pull_request_review

### 0.6.0 - 2019-11-30
- [#7](https://github.com/pdobb/pronto-bundler_audit/pull/7) Add configurability via .pronto-bundler_audit.yml file
  - For now, the only configuration available is ignoring advisories in the bundler_audit scan. See the [README](https://github.com/pdobb/pronto-bundler_audit#configuration).

### 0.5.1 - 2019-10-24
- Fix Pronto -> GitHub reporting errors
  - If Gemfile.lock is not in the PR then Pronto would fail when attempting to create a comment on the Gemfile.lock file withing the PR.
    - Note: This issue isn't fully fixed yet, but at least doesn't fail flat out.
      - To fully fix: would like to still add a PR-level comment with CVE issue(s) instead of requiring the user to dig into their CI output to see the CVE issue(s).
